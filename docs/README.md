# Docs

This directory contains long-form documentation and HOWTOs that were previously in the repository root. The goal is to keep the repository root focused on short, high-level files (README, LICENSE, packaging configs) while keeping detailed guides here so they are easy to find.

Moved docs:

- [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) — Installation instructions and notes.
- [BUILD_TIMELORD.md](./BUILD_TIMELORD.md) — Instructions for building timelords.

If you keep an external canonical copy in the Wiki, that is fine; keeping these files in-tree ensures documentation remains accessible without relying on the Wiki.
